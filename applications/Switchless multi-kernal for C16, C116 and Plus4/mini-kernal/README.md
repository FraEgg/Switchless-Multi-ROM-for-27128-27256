# Plus/4 Mini-Kernal

This is the assembly source code for the Plus/4 Mini-Kernal. It should in theory work with C16/C116 too but I haven't teste it as I don't have access to those systems.
The projects were created in CBM prg Studio. It needs to be built specifically for PAL or NTSC systems although it has only been tested with PAL systems.

You need to adjust the menu to fit your needs and compile the Mini-Kernals yourself unless you are going with the exact same Kernals I did.

## Disclaimer:  
I'm not an assembly programmer which you should be able to tell by looking at the source. If the code doesn't work for you feel free to fix it,
If anyone wants to have a go at improving and optimizing the code you are free to do so too.
